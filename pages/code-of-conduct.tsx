      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

      <p>
        We strive to create a friendly, welcoming, judgement- and
        harassment-free place for individuals to learn, connect, and share their
        appreciation for all things vim.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are a diverse, global community. We have members from every gender,
        sexuality, gender expression, race, ethnicity, tribal background,
        religious affiliation, citizenship and nationality, age, physical
        ability, educational background, experience level that you can think of
        - and want everyone to feel welcome!
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether attending our events, it’s not only our hope, but our
        expectation, that you’ll abide by these three basic ground rules:
      </p>

      <ul role="list">
        <li>We approach interactions with thoughtfulness and care.</li>

        <li>
          We are patient &amp; kind to others. We don’t dismiss someone because
          they have a different level of experience, are of a different
          background, or have a difference of opinion than us.
        </li>

        <li>We are respectful when we disagree with someone.</li>

        <li>
          There is a human in front of us. We don’t allow frustration to turn
          into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or
          threatened is not a productive one. We are collectively responsible
          for each other.
        </li>

        <li>We work to correct mistakes when they occur.</li>

        <li>
          No one is expected to always be perfect or to know everything -
          sometimes even good intentions have unwanted outcomes. But how we
          respond to criticism is important. If someone criticizes our conduct,
          or points out ways we have harmed someone, we listen without taking it
          personally, and work towards a resolution - together.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="my-8 text-3xl" id="we-will-not-tolerate-the-following">
        We will not tolerate the following:
      </h2>

      <ul role="list">
        <li>Violent threats or language.</li>

        <li>Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.</li>

        <li>
          Disrespecting people’s stated pronouns and gender identity, or current
          name.
        </li>

        <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>

        <li>
          Posting, or threatening to post, people’s personally identifying
          information (“doxing”).
        </li>

        <li>Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.</li>

        <li>Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.</li>

        <li>Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Written communication is easy to misinterpret. Ask for clarification
          before jumping to conclusions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Respect and use the correct pronouns for people when referring to
          them. Ask if you are not sure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Respect people’s boundaries, don’t dm or continue to interact with
          people if they have asked you not to.
        </li>
        <li>Do not spam or solicit other participants</li>
        <li>
          Consider thoughtful use of discussion threads to help keep useful
          conversations focussed
        </li>
        <li>
          Select the most appropriate channel for your conversation and avoid
          reposting the same messages across many channels in ways which may
          feel spammy.
